<p>
  Staring At The Sun assembled from fragments, signals, and things overheard on illegal transmissions. Their songs have been interpreted by listeners as quiet warnings or memories that don’t belong to them. The band has never confirmed either.

</p>
<p>If you hear something familiar that you can’t place, don’t try to understand it. If the songs feel like they’re watching you, stop listening. If you notice the sun lingering longer than it should, it’s already too late. Something vast is trying to communicate through the void.
